## Clean code

We are working with React & TypeScript, and you should always use the relevant best practices for these technologies, such as:

- **TypeScript:** always type your variables, functions and components. use `Partial` or `Omit` when needed. avoid using `any` unless you have a good reason to, and don't ignore TypeScript errors.
- **Memoization:** use `React.useMemo` or `React.useCallback` when needed to memoize values or functions.
- **DRY:** do not repeat yourself. If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, consider creating a function or a hook.
- **Semantics:** Use semantic HTML elements appropriately — `button` for buttons, input for inputs, `form` for forms, `a` for links, etc.
  You can also use the equivalent _MUI components_ (Button, TextField, Box, etc.) when it improves readability, styling consistency, or integration with the design system.
- **CSS**: We are using JSS for styling. You should optimize your style rules and avoid adding unnecessary rules that have no effect on the UI.

### Naming conventions

- **Components:** use PascalCase for components. For example, `LoginForm`, `UserCard`.
- **Hooks:** use `use` prefix for custom hooks. For example, `usePostAccountLogin`, `useAccount`.
- **Variables & Functions:** use camelCase for variables. For example, `isLoggedIn`, `userId`.
- **Constants:** use uppercase for constants. For example, `API_URL`, `MAX_LENGTH`.

Avoid using anonymous functions (!!!unless the purpose is obvious).

```tsx
// Bad *if* - unclear purpose of this effect
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, []);

// Good — named function makes the effect's purpose clear
useEffect(function handleEffect() {
  // ...
}, []);
```

### Organize your imports

- Group your imports in this order:

1. React imports (react, react-dom, hooks, etc.)
2. Third-party libraries (@mui/material, react-query, etc.)
3. Local imports (components, hooks, services, utils, styles)

-Folder exports:
Each folder should have its own index.ts or index.tsx file that re-exports all public modules from that folder.
This allows cleaner and more maintainable imports.
For example:
// services/tts/index.ts
export _ from "./ttsService";
export _ from "./ttsUtils";

Instead of:
import ttsService from "./services/tts/ttsService";
You can write:
import { ttsService } from "./services";

Use absolute imports (e.g., "@/components/Button") instead of long relative paths ("../../../Button") when possible.

### Writing components

Always use functional components. you should order your hooks in the following order (if possible):

1. Custom hooks — (useTranslation, useStyles, useAuth, etc.)
2. Static constants — config, arrays, enums, etc.
3. Refs — (const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);)
4. States — (useState)
5. Queries — (useQuery, useMutation)
6. Effects — (useEffect, useLayoutEffect)
7. Event handlers (const handleSearchChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
   setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
   };)
8. Memoized values
9. Render JSX

```tsx
import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState, ChangeEvent } from "react";
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
import { useAuth, useGetItems } from "@student/hooks";
import { useStyles } from "./styles";

export function SimpleExample() {
  // 1) Custom hooks
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  const classes = useStyles();
  const { userId } = useAuth();

  // 2) Refs
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  // 3) States
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");

  // 4) Queries
  const { data: items, isLoading } = useGetItems(searchTerm);

  // 5) Effects
  useEffect(function focusInputOnMount() {
    inputRef.current?.focus();
  }, []);

  // 6) Event handlers
  const handleSearchChange = (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSearchTerm(e.target.value);
  };

  // 7) Memoized values
  const title = useMemo(() => (userId ? t("Your Items") : t("Items")), [userId, t]);

  // 8) Render JSX
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <input ref={inputRef} style={classes.input} value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearchChange} placeholder={t("Search...")} />
      {isLoading ? (
        <p>{t("Loading...")}</p>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {items?.map((x) => (
            <li key={x}>{x}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Git & GitHub

### Creating a new branch

#### Naming your branch

Naming your branch is pretty straightforward, you should use the following format:

`your-name/task-number/short-description`

Put an effort into writing a short and descriptive name for your branch.

### Commit your changes

The most important rule: your commit message must clearly describe what changed and why.
Avoid vague messages like "update" or "fix stuff" — be specific and meaningful.

### PRs: CR

Once you're done with your changes, or you want to get feedback on your work, you should create a pull request. Here are some guidelines:

#### Creating a pull request

- Ensure you have run **npm run format**
- Make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the origin.
- If you have been working on a new feature, please create a Vitest test for that
- Mark as `Draft` if you're still working on it or if it's not ready for review.
- Write a descriptive title.
- Add a brief background about your changes in the description.
- Add a screenshot
- Assign the relevant labels to your pull request (don't forge to add the task number under "Development" section).

#### CR - Code Review

Once the behavior of your changes is approved, assign a team member to review your code. Make sure to address all the comments and suggestions before merging.

After your code is approved, you can merge your changes to the target branch.
